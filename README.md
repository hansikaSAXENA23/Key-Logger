# Key-Logger
A cybersecurity project using java language.

This is my first project on cybersecurity. I have coded a keylogger software code that records all the keys I press from my keyboard in a file named keylogs.txt. I have used java to code this because it is a cross platform programming language and I am most comfortable while using it. The cross platform feature comes in handy since now this code can be run on any OS supporting JVM.

However, there is a disadvantage attached to java in this particular case since with java we don't have access to the low-level APIs directly. To overcome this I used an external jar file name jnativehook. The link to download this jar file is https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook/releases
